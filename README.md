# AngularJS and ReactJS Performance
 
This repository builds off of the great work by Ben Nadel in his blog post,
[Rendering Large Datasets With AngularJS And ReactJS](http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2864-rendering-large-datasets-with-angularjs-and-reactjs.htm).
The source code for the original example is [here](https://github.com/bennadel/JavaScript-Demos/tree/master/demos/render-large-datasets-angularjs-reactjs).

This code takes the original code and adds Angular Benchpress tests to put actual
numbers on:

- Rendering the large grid.
- Searching within the grid.

It also compares this with Angular2.

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Protractor](https://angular.github.io/protractor/)
